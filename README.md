# Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. A developer would be requested to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

This website is a mobile-first design with a customized color palatte, with font sizes that are large enough to read, and colors don't cause eye strain.
